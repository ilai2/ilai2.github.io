<h1>Decision Tree Generator</h1><br>
<h2>We <span style="background-color:#ffb3ba">make decisions</span> in every aspect of our lives; understanding why we make the decisions we do is crucial to making better ones and improving our lives. This web app helps you generate <span style="background-color:#ffb3ba">decision tree diagrams</span> to visualize a decision in your life. Youâ€™ll need to know:<ol>
	<li>the <span style="background-color:#ffdfba">choices available</span> to you <br> &emsp; <i>I can eat ice cream or drink tea.</i></li>
	<li>the <span style="background-color:#ffffba">potential outcomes</span> of those choices <br> &emsp; <i>I'm lactose intolerant, so I might get an upset stomach if I eat ice cream. Nothing will happen if I drink tea.</i></li>
	<li>the <span style="background-color:#baffc9">probability of those outcomes</span> occurring <br> &emsp; <i>I think there's a 60% chance I have a negative reaction to the ice cream. There's a 100% chance I don't react negatively to tea.</i> </li>
	<li>the <span style="background-color:#bae1ff">value or utility</span> you place on each outcome <br> &emsp; <i> I really like ice cream though; I would give ice cream with no negative reaction 100 points. Even with the negative reaction, it's still 60 points. Tea is my favorite beverage, but it's not as good as ice cream: 70 points.</i></li>
