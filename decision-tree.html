<h1>Decision Tree Generator</h1><br>
<h2>We <span>make decisions</span> in every aspect of our lives; understanding why we make the decisions we do is crucial to making better ones and improving our lives. This web app helps you generate <span>decision tree diagrams</span> to visualize a decision in your life. Youâ€™ll need to know (1) the choices available to you, (2) the potential outcomes of those choices, (3) the probability of those outcomes occurring, and (4) the value or utility you place on each outcome.</h2>
