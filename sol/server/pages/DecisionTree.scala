  <li>the <spanyellow>potential outcomes</spanyellow> of those choices <br><teensy>I'm lactose intolerant, so I might get an upset stomach if I eat ice cream. Nothing will happen if I drink tea.</teensy></li>
  <li>the <spangreen>probability of those outcomes</spangreen> occurring <br>  <teensy>I think there's a 60% chance I have a negative reaction to the ice cream. There's a 100% chance I don't react negatively to tea.</teensy> </li>
  <li>the <spanblue>value or utility</spanblue> you place on each outcome <br><teensy> I really like ice cream though; I would give ice cream with no negative reaction 100 points. Even with the negative reaction, it's still 60 points. Tea is my favorite beverage, but it's not as good as ice cream: 70 points.</teensy></li>
